# Linear Systems Assignment

## Overview

This assignment focuses on solving systems of linear equations using NumPy in Python. The primary objective is to compute the solution to equations of the form **Ax = b** and validate the result using numerical testing methods.

## Files Included

- `assignment_3.py`: Contains the Python code to define matrices, solve the equations, and print results.
- `test_assignment_3.py`: Contains test cases using `np.testing.assert_allclose` to verify computed solutions.
- `README.md`: This file â€” explains the purpose, usage, and structure of the assignment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Install requirements (if needed):
```bash
pip install numpy
